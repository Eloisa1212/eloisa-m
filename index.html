<h1>Dreams and aspirations</h1>
<p>My biggest dream is to be a happy person for the rest of my life and to be able to accomplish every single goal that I have. In the future I would like to be a dermatologist and have a huge clinic of different aesthetic procedures. I would like to be very successful professionally and be recognized for my work. I would also like to live in a large house surrounded by plants with two golden retrivers as my pets and have three cars, one of them would be a black Porsche.  </p>

<h1>Pets</h1>
<p>I had a cat named Paco until the 9th of January when he sadly passed away. He was two years old, and he died because a snake bit him and the venom paralyzed all his body. Before that he went missing for around two hours and finally, we found him dead at my Neighbour's farm. Sadly, we found him late so he could not be saved. </p>

<h2>Favorite places:</h2>
<p>My favorite place in the entire world is a family farm that is located in Jerico because I have so many memories.
I don’t have specific favorite places, but one of the places that I like being at the most is at any beach, no matter where it is located. </p>
